Overview
========
The mu_polling example shows how to use MU driver in polling way:

In this example:
1. Core 0 send message to Core 1 in polling mode via MU module.
2. Core 1 send message back to Core 0 in polling mode.
3. Core 0 receive message sent from Core 1 in polling mode.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- VAR-SOM-MX8 STK
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
This example shows two cores communicating using MU. Both core0 and core1 polling example should be run at the same time!

When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the core0's debug terminal like as below:
