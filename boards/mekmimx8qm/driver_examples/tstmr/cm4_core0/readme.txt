Overview
========

The tstmr example shows the usage of TSTMR driver in application. The TSTMR module is a free running incrementing counter that starts running after system reset de-assertion and can be read at any time by the software for determining the software ticks.The TSTMR runs off the 1 MHz clock and resets on every system reset.

In this example, it would output a time stamp information when the application is ready. And then, delay for 1 second with TSTMR_DelayUs() function. Before and after the delay, it would output the two time stamps information again.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  8.50.9
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.


Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, will get the similar messages on the terminal.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
